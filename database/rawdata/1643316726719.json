There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.","ingredients":[{"id":1017,"name":"cream cheese","localizedName":"cream cheese","image":"cream-cheese.jpg"},{"id":18082,"name":"stuffing","localizedName":"stuffing","image":"stuffing-mix.png"},{"id":10111333,"name":"peppers","localizedName":"peppers","image":"green-pepper.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"lollipops","localizedName":"lollipops","image":"no.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"pop","localizedName":"soft drink","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":25,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"originalId":null,"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-baby-bell-pepper-appetizer-640508"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":17,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"aggregateLikes":48,"spoonacularScore":82,"healthScore":23,"creditsText":"Jen West","sourceName":"Pink When","pricePerServing":329.96,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":93740,"aisle":"Gluten Free;Health Foods","image":"almond-meal-or-almond-flour.jpg","consistency":"solid","name":"almond meal","nameClean":"almond meal","original":"1 1/2 cups almond meal","originalString":"1 1/2 cups almond meal","originalName":"almond meal","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.5,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":354.882,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"pepper.jpg","consistency":"solid","name":"black pepper","nameClean":"black pepper","original":"1 Tbsp black pepper","originalString":"1 Tbsp black pepper","originalName":"black pepper","amount":1,"unit":"Tbsp","meta":["black"],"metaInformation":["black"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":2031,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"chili-powder.jpg","consistency":"solid","name":"cayenne pepper","nameClean":"ground cayenne pepper","original":"1 tsp cayenne pepper","originalString":"1 tsp cayenne pepper","originalName":"cayenne pepper","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoon"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoon"}}},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"egg.png","consistency":"solid","name":"eggs","nameClean":"egg","original":"3 eggs (lightly beaten)","originalString":"3 eggs (lightly beaten)","originalName":"eggs (lightly beaten)","amount":3,"unit":"","meta":["lightly beaten","()"],"metaInformation":["lightly beaten","()"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":11052,"aisle":"Produce","image":"green-beans-or-string-beans.jpg","consistency":"solid","name":"fresh green beans","nameClean":"green beans","original":"1lb fresh green beans (snapped)","originalString":"1lb fresh green beans (snapped)","originalName":"fresh green beans (snapped)","amount":1,"unit":"lb","meta":["fresh","(snapped)"],"metaInformation":["fresh","(snapped)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pound"},"metric":{"amount":453.592,"unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams"}}},{"id":1022020,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"garlic-powder.png","consistency":"solid","name":"garlic powder","nameClean":"garlic powder","original":"1 Tbsp garlic powder","originalString":"1 Tbsp garlic powder","originalName":"garlic powder","amount":1,"unit":"Tbsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":2026,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"onion-powder.jpg","consistency":"solid","name":"onion powder","nameClean":"onion powder","original":"1 Tbsp onion powder","originalString":"1 Tbsp onion powder","originalName":"onion powder","amount":1,"unit":"Tbsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}}],"id":795749,"title":"Crispy Baked Green Bean Fries","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"http://www.pinkwhen.com/crispy-baked-green-bean-fries/","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/795749-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"The recipe Crispy Baked Green Bean Fries is ready <b>in around 45 minutes</b> and is definitely a great <b>caveman, gluten free, dairy free, and primal</b> option for lovers of American food.
