Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

Rinse duck legs and pat dry. Lay legs skin side up in a roasting pan that just holds them comfortably. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the herbes de Provence.                                                                                                 Roast duck in preheated oven for 1 hour. Spoon fat from pan and save for other uses or discard. Pour wine over duck; it should be deep enough so meat is immersed but skin is exposed. Continue roasting until skin is golden red, about 30 minutes longer (20 minutes if using convection heat).                                                                                                 Meanwhile, pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan over medium-high heat; add shallots and stir often until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf; boil, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 45 minutes. When duck is done, add 1 cup braising liquid to broth mixture and boil, stirring often, until mixture is reduced by about one-fourth, about 15 minutes. Pour through a fine strainer into a small pitcher or bowl.                                                                                                 While broth reduces, prepare greens: In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, melt butter with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add onion and stir often until beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Add greens (if using mustard greens, add half, stir until wilted, then add remaining) and cook, stirring often, until tender to bite, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and the anchovy, if using, and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt, pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice.

Add the bread pieces, toss to coat, and cook, turning periodically, until golden on the outside but still tender inside, 12 to 15 minutes. Let them cool in one layer on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper to taste.    Remove the outer leaves of romaine until you reach the tightly packed heart (the leaves will be much paler); set the outer leaves aside for another use. Separate the leaves of the heart and slice them into pieces about 3 inches long (leave the smallest leaves whole) to yield a heaping 8 cups of loosely packed leaves. Rinse and dry very thoroughly.    Put the garlic and a pinch of kosher salt in a large (3- to 4-cup) mortar. Using a pestle, pound the garlic into a creamy, juicy paste. (Alternatively, mince the garlic very finely and sprinkle it with coarse salt. Then repeatedly drag the flat side of the blade at the knife's tip across the minced garlic to press into a paste. Transfer it to a bowl.) Add the anchovies, mashing until they're broken down into bits. Add the yolk, working the mixture into a paste. Work in the mustard and then the lemon juice. Blend in a pinch of black pepper, the Tabasco, and the Worcestershire. Switch to a whisk and drizzle in the olive oil, whisking continuously until blended and creamy.    Put the lettuce, parsley, and croutons in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and toss. Add the dressing and toss to coat thoroughly. Sprinkle with 2 to 3 Tbs. of the Parmigiano and toss again. Serve immediately with the remaining cheese on the side.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      230, Fat                        (kcal):                      20, Fat Calories                        (g):                      180, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      4, Protein                        (g):                      7, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      13, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      8, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      2, Sodium                        (g):                      1040, Cholesterol                        (g):                      45, Fiber                        (g):                      2,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the croutons, warm the oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat.","ingredients":[{"id":18242,"name":"croutons","localizedName":"croutons","image":"croutons.png"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the bread pieces, toss to coat, and cook, turning periodically, until golden on the outside but still tender inside, 12 to 15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":18064,"name":"bread","localizedName":"bread","image":"white-bread.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":12,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Let them cool in one layer on paper towels.
