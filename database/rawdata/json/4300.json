Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Caposaldo Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":447842,"title":"Caposaldo Pinot Grigio","description":"Caposaldo Pinot Grigio features a dry, crisp, vibrant texture and delicate aromas of white fruit, flowers and almonds.\nPairs well with white meats, fish, seafood, pasta dishes and delicate cheeses.","price":"$9.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447842-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":17,"score":0.8807692307692307,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcaposaldo-pinot-grigio-2013%2F140350"}]},"instructions":"Put the cilantro, lime juice,  cup olive oil, onion, garlic, jalapeno, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, and salt and pepper in the bowl of a food processor.Blend until smooth.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 46 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":467219,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris","description":"Bright yellow/gold color, quite luminous. Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and salt. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook 15 minutes, then turn off heat and let sit 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.                                                                                                 Meanwhile, bring 1 in. of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Peel sweet potato and cut into 1/2-in. cubes. Put in a steamer basket over boiling water. Cover and steam until tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside.                                                                                                 While sweet potato is cooking, spoon about 1/4 cup from top of coconut milk in each can (the thick opaque layer) and put in a 4- to 5-qt. pot or deep saut pan. Add curry paste and whisk until smoothly blended. Stir mixture over medium heat until nearly dry, 3 to 5 minutes.                                                                                                 Reduce heat to medium-low and add remaining coconut milk, lime zest, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Simmer 5 minutes.                                                                                                 Meanwhile, cut fish into 1 1/2-in. cubes. Increase heat to medium; add fish and spinach. Cover and cook until fish is no longer translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.

Cut into 1/4- by 1/2- by 2-in. strips to ensure quick cooking.                                                                                                Pork: Use tenderloin in place of the fish, trimming fat and cutting meat into 1/4-in.-thick strips.

Season the fish with salt and lots of pepper. Add the fish to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn the fish and continue cooking over moderate heat until barely opaque throughout, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer the fish to a plate.

Grill bread, turning once, until edges are browned, 1 to 3 minutes.                                                                                                 Fillet fish (see step 4 below).

Cover with the herbs and garlic. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.                                                      For the vegetables, preheat the oven to 550 degrees. Sprinkle both sides of the portobellos generously with salt and pepper. Put them in a roasting pan and scatter the thyme and garlic over them. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Roast until the mushrooms are soft, sliding a spatula underneath them from time to time, about 12 minutes. Quarter the mushrooms and set them aside.                                                      Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cut off the asparagus tips and reserve the stalks for another use. Blanch the tips until just tender, about 1 minutes. Drain and refresh under cold running water. Drain again and set aside.                                                      Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over high heat. Add half the tomato slices in a single layer. Saut until the slices are browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn and brown the other side, about 1 minute more. Set the tomatoes aside and wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and Saut the remaining tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. (The vegetables can be made up to 1 day ahead; cover and refrigerate.)                                                      For the sauce, heat the com oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the beef and brown it on all sides, about 2 minutes. Pour off the fat. Add the brandy and deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits from the bottom. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and lower the heat to medium. Add the green peppercorns, cream, and demi-glace. Season with salt and pepper, if needed, depending on the spiciness of the peppercorns. Simmer for 8 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and simmer until the sauce is thick, about 7 minutes longer. Remove and discard the beef. (The sauce can be made up to 2 hours ahead; refrigerate.)                                                      Start a large charcoal fire or preheat an indoor grill. When very hot, place the slate on the grill. Heat the slate until very hot, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Season the monkfish on both sides with salt and pepper. Pour half the oil from the marinade over the slate and lay the monkfish on top. Place the herbs and garlic back over the fish. After a few minutes, run a spatula under the fish to prevent it from sticking.                                                      Grill until the fish is well browned on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Pour the remaining oil from the marinade on the slate, turn the fish over, and put the herbs and garlic back on top. Grill for 10 to 12 minutes, until a metal skewer can be easily inserted into the fish and feels hot when touched to your lip.                                                      Meanwhile, alternate pieces of portobello and tomato in a ring around the platter, leaving room in the center for the fish. Lay the asparagus tips over the mushrooms and tomatoes. Place the platter in the oven just to reheat the vegetables, about 2 minutes. Reheat the sauce.                                                      Place the monkfish in the center of the platter, covered with the herbs. Serve immediately, carving the fish at the table into -inch-wide slices. Pass the sauce separately.
