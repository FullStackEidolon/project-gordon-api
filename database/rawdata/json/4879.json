In a large cazuela or medium Dutch oven or another heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and nearly translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.                                                    Add the garlic, tomatoes, and 2 pinches of salt and cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomato has darkened to a deeper shade of red and the sofrito is pasty, 10 to 15 minutes.                                                    Preheat oven to 400F.                                                    When the sofrito is ready, sprinkle in the pimentn and saffron, letting the flavors meld for a few seconds while stirring constantly.                                                    Add the stock, increase the heat, and bring to a boil. Add the rice and peas. With a wooden spoon, probe the pan to make sure the rice is evenly distributed. Check for salt, adjusting the seasoning as needed.                                                    Cook, uncovered, over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, gently stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat.                                                    Working quickly, lay the sardines across the top of the rice like spokes on a wheel, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and place in the hot oven.                                                    Bake until most of the liquid is absorbed (it doesnt need to be dry), the rice is al punto, with just a bite to it, and the eyes of the sardines are cloudy, about 10 minutes.

Dust exposed flesh with a liberal dose of salt and freshly ground black pepper.                                  Completely cover exposed flesh with sesame seeds, enough to form a nice layer over the top. Drizzle liberally with 1/4 cup olive oil.                                  Heat large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil (just enough to barely cover the bottom of the panyou dont want it swimming, only enough to just prevent sticking). When pan and oil are hot, flip and slip salmon in gently, skin-side up, so sesame seeds do not fly off. Sear for approximately 5 to 7 minutes until golden brown. Do not give into the temptation to toss or move salmon fillet. Let it sit there so sesame seeds get seared into flesh of salmon. Sprinkle more salt and freshly ground pepper over exposed skin.                                  When golden brown, flip fillet over and cook for another two minutes or so.                                   Pour 3/4 cup red wine over salmon, lower heat to medium or just above, and let cook another five minutes or so. Sauce should be boiling quite vigorously, but you dont want it to burn or smoke, so adjust the temperature as needed.                                  When cooked through, but still slightly pink in center, remove to serving platter and place flesh-side up.                                   Keep sauce boiling on medium heat and add additional 3/4 cup red wine. Lower heat to medium-low and let reduce for about another five minutes, stirring occasionally to release and loosen all those great cooked bits and flavor from the pan. Cook for about an additional five minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by half. Adjust for salt if necessary.                                  Pour sauce over fillet. Garnish with parsley and serve.
