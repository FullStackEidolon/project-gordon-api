To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Hay Shed Hill Pitchfork Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2044170,"title":"Hay Shed Hill Pitchfork Chardonnay","description":" Brilliant appearance, pale straw with green hues. Fermentation in stainless steel tank allows the full expression of Chardonnay fruit aroma without the influence of oak or lees resulting in a bright, clean tropical fruit bouquet. The palate is rich with tropical fruits, clean zippy acidity balances the sweet fruit character resulting in a bright fresh flavorsome palate. When good quality Chardonnay is used unwooded Chardonnay takes on a whole new level of depth and intensity.","price":"$18.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/2044170-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.9473684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fhay-shed-hill-pitchfork-chardonnay-2020%2F782099"}]},"instructions":"Immerse and soak the plank in water 1 hour; drain.

Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon.

Process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside 3/4 cup for the salad.      Thirty minutes before roasting the salmon, pour the remaining marinade over the salmon in a large rimmed dish and let sit at room temperature. (For the best texture, don't marinate longer than 30 minutes.)      While the salmon is marinating, position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 400F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. When ready to roast the salmon, remove it from the marinade and set on the baking sheet. Bake until just firm to the touch and opaque in the center (use a paring knife to peek), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for 10 minutes.        Make the salad:           In a medium bowl, mix the cucumbers, onion, olives, cheese, and 1-1/2 tsp. salt. Toss with the reserved buttermilk dressing and season to taste with more salt and pepper.        Serve:     Use two large spatulas to carefully move the salmon to a platter. Spoon some of the cucumber salad around the salmon and serve the rest in a bowl on the side.    Make Ahead Tips    Prep the cucumber salad up to 3 hours ahead, but do not add the salt or dressing until just before serving.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      230, Fat                        (kcal):                      7, Fat Calories                        (g):                      60, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Protein                        (g):                      27, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      2.5, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      4, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      2, Sodium                        (g):                      340, Cholesterol                        (g):                      80, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Marinate and roast the salmon","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a food processor, combine the buttermilk, basil, cilantro, scallions, vinegar, honey, ginger, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper.
