Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

Set aside for at least 30 minutes or up to several weeks.                                                            Marinate the Fish                Pour the olive oil into a small bowl and add the ancho chile powder, oregano, cumin, chopped cilantro, and jalapeño. Mix well. Place the fish on a dish and pour the marinade over it, making sure to coat the fish well on both sides. Allow to marinate for 20 minutes.                                                            Cook the Fish                Heat a nonstick sauté pan over medium-high heat. Remove the fish from the marinade and place in the hot pan (there is no need to add more oil). Season the fish with salt. Cook the fish for 4 minutes undisturbed, then turn over, and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and flake the fish into the pan with a fork, making sure to mix in all the marinade that has stuck to the bottom of the pan. Check for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Set aside.                                                            Heat the Tortillas                Place four of the tortillas on a plate and sandwich them between two slightly dampened sheets of paper towel. Microwave on high for 45 seconds. Place the warm tortillas in a towel-lined basket or plate and cover. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.                                                             Assemble and Serve                To assemble the tacos, place a heaping spoonful of the marinated flaked fish onto the center of a tortilla. Top with the marinated onions. Serve accompanied by Mexican crema and salsa.

COOKING NOTES            INGREDIENTSFishYou can use any fish you like so long as you can flake the flesh when it is cooked. Most white fish fall under this category.TECHNIQUESMarinated OnionsOnce you make this very simple condiment, you will find yourself keeping a container of these onions in your refrigerator to add to all of your dishes.Don't be alarmed by the amount of vinegar needed to cover the onions completely. Since you will most likely have onions leftover, keep them submerged in the vinegar in a refrigerated airtight container. You can then use the vinegar for your other cooking needs. The onions will keep for several weeks. ADVANCE PREPARATIONThe onions and fish can be made up to a day in advance. When reheating the fish, you may want to add about 1 tablespoon of water to make sure the fish does not dry out.

Place the eel on a baking sheet and warm in the oven for 5 minutes. Bring it out and inspect it for pinbones and extract any you find while it is still warm. Place the eel in a bowl and, using a fork, shred it. Add the potatoes, egg yolks, chives, mustard, and shallot to the eel and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the texture appears too soft to form a consistent nugget, mix in a tablespoon or two of crushed cornflakes (from the crust ingredients) to help bind the ingredients. Refrigerate for about 20 minutes or so, or until chilled. Using your hands, shape the eel mixture into rectangular nuggets about 1 by 1 inches (2.5 by 4 cm).  For the Crust  Set up your 3-bowl assembly line: put the seasoned flour in a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk in a second shallow bowl, and put the crushed cornflakes in a third bowl. Carefully yet generously coat each nugget in the flour, then dunk it in the egg bath, and finally give it a good roll in the crumbs. Reshape to make sure you have that negligently perfect nugget form. Now, put all the nuggets through the triple coating again. Refrigerate for about 10 minutes to help the crust set. Pour the oil to a depth of 3 inches (7.5 cm) into your deep fryer (or according to the manufacturers instructions) and heat to 350F (180C). (Or, use a thick-bottomed, high-sided pot and a deep-fat thermometer.) Working in batches, fry the nuggets for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they get that classic nugget color. Drain briefly on paper towels, pat them dry, and serve with one or all of the sauces.  For the Honey Mustard  Mix together  cup (60 ml) strong Dijon mustard,  cup (85 g) honey, and 1 tablespoon each mustard seeds and chopped fresh dill.  For the Classic Tartar Sauce  Mix together  cup (125 ml) mayonnaise; 1 tablespoon each finely chopped capers, gherkins, tarragon, and shallot; a pinch of sugar; a dash or two of Tabasco sauce; and 1 tablespoon pickle brine.  For the Piri Piri Honey  Warm  cup (85 g) honey for about 30 seconds, then mix in 1 or 2 piri piri (African bird) or other small crushed dried chiles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Filling  Preheat the oven to 400F (200C).","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the eel on a baking sheet and warm in the oven for 5 minutes.

It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447842,"title":"Caposaldo Pinot Grigio","description":"Caposaldo Pinot Grigio features a dry, crisp, vibrant texture and delicate aromas of white fruit, flowers and almonds.\nPairs well with white meats, fish, seafood, pasta dishes and delicate cheeses.","price":"$9.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447842-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":17,"score":0.8807692307692307,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcaposaldo-pinot-grigio-2013%2F140350"}]},"instructions":"Preparation                                        For jerusalem artichoke puree:                Workingwith 1 artichoke at a time, peel and cut into1/2-inch cubes.

Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris.

Add the grouper fillets and poach over low heat for 6 minutes, until partially cooked. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a plate. Pour 4 cups of the poaching liquid into a medium bowl; discard the rest.                                              Pour 2 cups of the reserved poaching liquid into a bowl and add the tamarind; use a potato masher to break up the tamarind as much as you can.

In a small skillet, combine the soaked red chiles, garlic, curry powder, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and belacan and toast over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the seasonings to a spice grinder and let cool. Grind the seasonings to a dry paste.                                              Wipe out the deep skillet and add the vegetable oil. Add the mustard seeds and cook over moderately low heat until they begin to pop, about 30 seconds. Add the spice paste and cook, stirring, until the color deepens slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the onion, curry leaves and lemongrass and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 8 minutes.                                              Add the tamarind juice to the skillet and bring to a boil. Add the coconut milk, okra, eggplant, tomatoes, Thai chiles, sugar and the remaining 2 cups of poaching liquid and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and cook the curry over low heat until the vegetables are tender and the liquid is thickened slightly, about 40 minutes.                                              Cut the fish into 2-inch pieces and nestle them in the sauce.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day. The wine is anchored by crisp acidity, but not so much as to overpower a fleeting tease of sweetness that leaves you smiling.
