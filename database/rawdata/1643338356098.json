Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven. I left the organs and the neck for added flavor.\n2. Put garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken\n3. Chop the onion and scatter around the bottom of the pan. Pour in water.\nSalsa Verde\n1. Remove the hulls from the tomatillos. They will be sticky, don't worry if you can't wash it all off. Remove the stems.\n2. Place all the tomatillos and chiles into a sauce pot. Cover with water and boil until soft.\n3. Remove the tomatillos and chiles from the water and place in a blender. Add all the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.\n4. It's as simple as that. A yummy salsa perfect for tamales, eating with chip or putting on top of whatever you're eating!\nTamale Dough (Masa)\nMix all together to make a soft, sticky dough.\nSalsa Verde Tamales\nTamale Dough\nShreded chicken\n2 cups Salsa Verde\n10 to 40 green olives\n4 medium potatoes\n1. Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable.\n2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde.\n3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don't have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside.\n4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don't have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside.\n5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot.\n6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit.\n7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides.\n8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can't remember the exact amount I used.\n9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end.\n10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don't.\n11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes.\n12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later. Simply let them defrost and steam until warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roasted Chicken","ingredients":[{"id":5114,"name":"roasted chicken","localizedName":"roasted chicken","image":"rotisserie-chicken.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven.

Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan and place on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely.\nPrepare the simple syrup glaze by placing all of the ingredients in a small pot and bringing to a boil. Boil about 3 minutes and remove from heat. Set aside to cool.\nPrepare frosting by beating the softened cream cheese in a medium bowl until creamy and lump free. Add half the whipping cream and beat on low about 30 seconds.\nAdd half the powdered sugar and beat until all the sugar is mixed in.\nAdd remaining whipping cream and beat until creamy.\nAdd the last of the powdered sugar and beat well, about 2 minutes. Add almond extract and beat for about 30 seconds.\nTurn the mixer on high and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\nAssemble the cake\nTrim any uneven parts off the top of your first layer by sawing a serrated knife along the top until the top is level.\nPlace on a cake stand or plate. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the cake with an even layer of the simple syrup.  Trim the second layer of cake and place on a cooling rack. Brush with simple syrup and set aside. Discard any left over syrup.\nAllow syrup to soak into the cake layers for about 5 or 10 minutes.\nSpread about a cup of frosting over the top of the first cake layer to about a  inch from the edge. Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the frosting to about an  inch from the edge of the frosting.\nCarefully place the second layer of cake on top of the first layer being careful not to put too much pressure on the filling. You dont want the filling to start to ooze out from the sides of the cake.\nTake about 1 cup of frosting out of the bowl and put it into a smaller bowl. This is to prevent the chocolate crumbs from the cake to get into the bowl of frosting.\nYou dont want flecks of cake in your white frosting.\nSpread a thin but even layer of frosting on the sides of the cake. Be sure to fill the space between both cake layers with frosting. This will trap the filling between both cake layers.\nFrost the top of the cake with a thin layer of frosting.\nChill for about an hour to set the frosting.\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top.\nForm an edge in the frosting on the top of the cake by pushing down into the frosting and building up a ledge of frosting with a small spatula along the edge of the cake.\nYou may have to even out the frosting in the center by removing a thin layer  of frosting until the edges are higher then the center of the cake.\nAdd cherry pie filling to the top filling in the center of the frosting.\nChill before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the cake per box directions.

Pulse until the mushrooms are finely minced and all of the ingredients are well combined. It will help if youve given the mushrooms a bit of a rough chop first, or if you use pre-sliced mushrooms.\nPlace a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape.\nPlace a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.\nDip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.\nStand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)\nHeat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones.\n*Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor.

Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.\nDissolve the yeast in a medium sized bowl with 1/3 cup warm water and the sugar. Stir together, then let sit 10 minutes.\nAdd the Coach Oats mixture to yeast mixture and add the butter, salt, molasses, honey, wheat germ and milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and with the paddle attachment, mix together to combine.\nAdd the one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of the all purpose flour. Mix until well combined. Clean off the paddle attachment, scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dough attachment to the mixer.\nWith the mixer going on low speed, add the remaining whole wheat flour a little at a time until the dough starts coming together.\nAfter two of the remaining cups are added, let the mixer knead the dough for a minute or so. If it is still sticking to the sides, add about 1/4 cup more flour, let it mix. Keep adding a little flour at a time until the ball of dough no longer sticks to the sides. Let it knead for 8-10 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the bowl from the mixer.\nTake the dough out of the bowl and spray it with cooking spray. Return the ball of dough to the bowl, cover it with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, dry place for an hour until doubled in size (mine took almost 2 hours).\nPunch down the dough and make 2.50 ounce sized balls of doughyoull get about 19 rolls. Set them on a baking sheet and cover with a tea towel. Let them rise for about 45 minutes.\nDuring the last 20 minutes of rise time, preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nFill a dutch oven or oven safe pot with water and place on the lowest shelf of the oven, this will add steam in the oven.\nBrush each roll with egg wash.
